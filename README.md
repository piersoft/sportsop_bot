Config:
In localhost is possible to launch
php start.php 'sethook' to set start.php as webhook
php start.php 'removehook' to remove start.php as webhook
php start.php 'getupdates' to run getupdates.php

After setup webhook is possible to use telegram managed by webhost


To use the application use "start.php getupdates" for manual execution. "start.php sethook" for Telegram webhook execution.



Good Luck!
